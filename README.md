"# Quiz-Web" 


Quiz Web is an interactive web-based quiz application built with React. Users can answer a set of questions and get a detailed result summary showing the percentage of correct, skipped, and wrong answers.


#Features :

1. Timer-based questions: Each question has a timer; if time runs out, the question is skipped automatically.
2. Answer validation: The application checks if the selected answer is correct, wrong, or skipped.
3. Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
4. Result Summary: After completing the quiz, users are presented with a detailed summary including:
5. Percentage of correct answers
6. Percentage of skipped questions
7. Percentage of wrong answers
8. Shuffled Answers: Answer choices are randomly shuffled to prevent patterns.
